**13.1: Test for Palindromic Permutations**

*   Test whether the letters forming a string can be permuted to form a palindrome
    *   **e.g.** "edified" can be changed to "deified"

`bool PermuteToPalindrome(const std::string &subject_string);`

**13.2:**

*   x

**13.3: x**

**13.6: Find Nearest Repeated Entries**

*   Given an array of strings, find the distance between the closest pair of equal entries. 
*   Return the distance 

*   **Examples:**
    *   `All work and no play makes for no work no fun and no results` - the second and third `no` strings are the closest

`int ShortestEqualValueDistance(const std::vector<std::string> &str_list)`
